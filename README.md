# pandas-stubs
stubs for common pandas classes for static type checking (e.g. with mypy).

Files in this repo are initially generated by `stubgen` (part of `mypy`) running on `pandas` source code. Manual edits are made on top of that to make type-checking work. This is work in progress.

### How to use this:
Instructions for using with `mypy`:
1. Clone the repo to some folder, e.g. `~/pandas-stubs`
2. Add the above folder path into either `MYPYPATH` environment variable, or as part of the `mypy_path` variable in a config file. See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_file.html#import-discovery for details about the mypy config file.
3. Run `mypy` to typecheck.
